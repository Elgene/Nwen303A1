/**
 * Parallel merge sort implemented using CompletableFutures.
 * Completable futures can use threads much more efficiently than regular futures because a new thread
 * is not created until the old thread has finished. This means that there are never any threads waiting
 * for other threads to finish.
 * It is very easy to control the order of operations when using CompletableFutures, for example you can
 * easily have one thread depend on the completion of two or more other threads (which is used in this method).
 *
 * I learned that CompletableFutures are a lot easier to use than they originally seemed, and provide a very fast
 * and efficient way to do parallelization.
